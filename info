STEVAL-FKI915V1

The STEVAL-FKI915V1 evaluation board 
is based 
on the S2-LP sub-1GHz 
ultra-low power 
low data-rate 
transceiver 
suitable 
for ISM bands 
and 
wireless M-Bus. 
The NUCLEO-L152RE main board 
with an STM32L low power MCU 
controls 
the S2-LP 
and 
integrates 
the ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger 
and 
programmer 
for firmware updating.
The STEVAL-FKI915V1 
includes 
an external power amplifier 
from SkyWorks®, 
which allows the application 
to reach +27 dBm (500 mW) output power
